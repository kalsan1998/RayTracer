TODOs:

-- Photon mapping: Caustics and radiosity
- Make number of emitted photons scale relative to image resolution?
- Balance kd-tree
- Make own heap data structure?

-- clean up args for main function (make RayTracer a class?)

-- Depth of field
-- Soft shadows
-- OBJ file advanced parsing: materials

-- Optimization: Don't calculate normal and uv in intersection function. For checking shadows we
don't need this.

Past Issues:
-- Dodeca in `nonhier.lua` had pixelated shadows. Issue was that the origin was being counted as an
intersection, which gave a tiny t-val that would be selected as the min and get ignored in the
epsilon check.

-- Boxes would cause funky behaviour when rays had 0 slope on x,y, or z.

-- Full cylinder and shadows weren't rendered. Changed min hit count to 1 from 2. Also had to change
t_val check to check that both t vals were greater than 0.001 to prevent random shadows.

-- Mesh does not cast shadow on itself. This happened because the intersection for boxes only consider
the min t val, which could be behind the eye.

-- Shadows were being cast when object was behind the light source
